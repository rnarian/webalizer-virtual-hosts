# Webalizer Virtual Hosts

Shell Script to process multiple hosts individually using the 'webalizer' command.

In order to make this Script work, we need to generate seperate 'access.log's for our vhosts. We assume that the name of the vhosts occur in our public_html folder as well as in our logfile.
